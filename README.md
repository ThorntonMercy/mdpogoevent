Event Center HTML CSS Project


Our task was to create an event website with five pages:
1. Index
2. Events
3. Menu
4. Location
5. Contact Us

I went with a Pokemon Go theme as I play regularly and know of several groups who use resources like Discord to coordinate meet-ups, giveaways, and other cool things. 

All pages:
1. I verified with the inspect tool that, utilizing media queries, the nav bar, flex boxes, and all content
 will display as it should on various screen sizes.
2. All pages have a header, banner, and footer.
3. All pages are controlled through one CSS style sheet.
4. Utilizes media queries to ensure that the navbar, header, and header text remains intact and wraps appropriately regardless of the screensize. 


Index: 
1. Includes the hero image/banner at full size.
2. Includes the welcome statement (hey trainer), about us section (gotta catch them all).
3. Includes the *Bonus* featured section with small images, clickable as links, and a brief description.

Events:
1. Uses semantic HTML elements (section, etc.) and flex box styling.
2. Showcases several events, with information such as event name, date, time, and brief details suitable for the targeted audience.

Menu:
1. Table has multiple category headers with two rows, showcasing various dining options.
2. *bonus* Striped rows for styling and better readability.
3. Utilizes flexbox to contain the table and the generic food image.
4. In the event that you're viewing on a small screen, the image will stack below the table.

Location: 
1. Includes an address, and technically hours, although the type of event site that I chose to go with doesn't have set event hours / consistent play times.
2. Includes a centered, embedded google map.
3. Styling elements will make sure that the map sizes down appropriately regardless of screensize, but will not exceed 600px on an oversized / normal sized screen.

Contact:
1. Styled form with form validation / required fields for name, email, and message.
2. Optional "inquiry type" select dropdown menu to give an idea of the nature of message.

Styling: 
1. Most pages use semantic html and flexbox layouts
2. Hover effects given for links
