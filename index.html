            <p>
                We are a tight knit community of Pokemon Go players all throughout the great
                state of Maryland! Our members are all super welcoming, supportive, and we've
                got a large player base of all ages. We regularly host different meetups to
                take advantage of in-game events like Spotlight Hours, Community Days, and more!
            </p>
            <p>
                We have some awesome local vendors selling a variety of Pokemon themed
                merchandise. Our talented friends can set you up with some awesome stuffed
                plushes, jewelry, custom bags, apparel, and even some tasty treats!
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of our events also have free to enter raffles for cool prizes like pins,
                magnets, and other swag. Everyone is welcome to show up, hang out, and maybe
                end the day with some new friends.
